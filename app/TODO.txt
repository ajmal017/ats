TODO:

1) Update imports in request so we don't have to individually import - follow azure-sdk example
2) update ibapi so we don't have contractdetails.summary in my fork and then update the setconnoptions (also look into methods with multiple loganswer)
    create pr back to ib?
3) convert over to historicalrequests
4) try bar requests (i.e a subscription)
5) add way to deal with errors more gracefully - cancelling all the shit
6) account impl
7) logging
8) implement order retreival and management
9) Strategy -> on bar
10) talib -> compute the Bb bandwdith/position
11) request just a few bars of 5s for testing of something like SPX.
12) lots of tests




Longer term - write code to inspect API and figure out if names have changed
        - have the request encode the args to the api? i.e. self.args = { "reqId": 2, "contract": self.contract } then brokerplatform could just do reqXXXX(**request.args)



    ---------

    stock app
  - save contract info during data download
 - emit the latest date and stop there
 - use the error codes to stop?


- create an app that goes through and makes sure we have data for all of the open days for the same symbols.
